simple-javascript-GDPR-cookie-and-country-checker

This setup allows for a cross installation GDPR cookie. It will still need to be connected to a form which allows turning the GDPR consent on and off but this can be accomplished with button click calls to the appropriate GDPR cookie set functions.

I'm open to suggestions on how to improve this.

## Setup contains
1. a Javascript file with all relevant functions
2. an HTML file with the GDPR consent bar div container
3. a CSS file with the styles for the consent bar

## Installation
1. Install the javascript as a <head> include.
2. Add the consent bar div right before the footer area.
3. Install the CSS as a <head> include.
